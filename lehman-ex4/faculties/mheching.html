        <li>i transfered here from another Cuny school after getting my Associate's degree and let me tell you that this school is a huge breath of fresh air compared to my other school! The staff is super friendly, the professors are great, food is great and there are so many social activites! The re are definitely plenty of opportubities to succeed here!</li>
        <li>The opportunities/networking/social events can be better. The food is overpriced and taste like it should be a 60% each time, except for maybe the salad. The food can be way better, for what it's cost</li>
        <li>If you drive you can usually find parking on the street. Teachers are ok some better than others, some are on a power trip use this site it helps, if you have to do financial aide get it done early those lines are ridiculous. Also if you are transferring and have over 100 credits fight for as many as you can, I had over 120 and they only took 60.</li>
        <li>Great campus, most professors are well regarded in their fields, facilities are nice, parking is terrible, food is expensive and not that good.</li>
        <li>Overall, I would enjoy this school a lot more if the faculty actually knew what they were talking about when asked questions, or if they did not just assume that we came into the school knowing everything. I do not find the staff to be very supportive.</li>
